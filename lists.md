# Lists 
This list is a sequence of values, now the values in a list are called ELEMENTS or Items.
 There are many ways to make a list 
-The Simplest way is to use these brackets []
Examples of Lists are : 
-[10, 20, 30, 40]
-['crunchy dog', 'ram bladder, 'lark vomit'] 
A List also can contain several datatypes like the integer, string, float and also another list
 For the list methods we have :
-Extend,
-Append,
This two are used to add to a list 
-Extend is used to add a list to another list, basically append a list to another list.
-The Append is used to add an Item to the end of an exsiting list. 
Now for deleting an item on a list the method ```pop()``` is used like years.pop()
This removs the last item in the list.
-Also an argument can be passed in the ()
-Also we can remove the element if we know it but not the value by using the remove method ```remove(value)```
-For spliting strings (words) to single alphanet we  use the list functions ( it is in built) ```list()```.
-To split a sentence into words in to a list we use the ```split()``` also in built
