# This is s file I created with a python program 
 So I wanted to do this to learn how to manipulate and use files in python.
-Something I have learnt so far is the used of the ``write()`` method, 
 also the use os the (w) to signify that the file was opened in the write mode. 
-Now the next thing is to use the ```close()``` method to close the file 
 and make sure the last bit of data is physically written in the file.
-The use of the ```repr()`` method so it helps to make sure everything returns as a string.
-Now there is also the use of ((forward slash and t for tab?)1	 2, 1	 3 and 1
3 (forward slash and n for new line?))
